# Traffic-Light-Contoller-System-using-Counting-of-Vehicles-
Sure! I can provide you with a basic example of a traffic light controller system using vehicle counting in MATLAB. This example assumes you have access to a video feed or image sequence where vehicles can be detected. Keep in mind that this is a simplified implementation and might require additional adjustments and optimizations .
